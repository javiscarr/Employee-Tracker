# Description

This application is a `content management systems` interface that allows users who are non-developers the ability to interact with information that is stored into database. Users will have the ability to store information such as departments, roles, employees and salary. This information is stored in many tables which are linked together to provide the information that coordinates with the selections made during the process of adding, updating and deleting information. Ideally, this database is a way to keep your business organized and make any necessary adjustments that may be needed along the way.
